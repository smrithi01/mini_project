"Changes in CSF flow : MR CSF flow studies in NPH shows an increase in peak CSF velocity in the cerebral aqueduct, as well as an increase in CSF volumes in the aqueduct. A subsidiary feature of the increased aqueduct velocity on routine brain MRI is the presence of voids in the CSF flow. Although  traditionally  considered  a  useful  sign  for  NPH,  they are increasingly seen in normal subjects examined on  higher field MRI scanners [1,2,10].â€¢Changes      in      brain      composition:      Periventricular      hypoattenuation  on  CT,  or  the  corresponding  high  T2 FLAIR  signal  on  MRI,  may  be  considered  a  supportive  sign for NPH. However, this is a nonspecific feature, as periventricular  changes  are  common  in  the  elderly  brain,  reflecting chronic microvascular ischemia, or even in the setting  of  acute  hydrocephalus  as  transependymal  edema  ",change in csf flow mr csf flow study in nph show an increase in peak csf velocity in the cerebral aqueduct a well a an increase in csf volume in the aqueduct a subsidiary feature of the increased aqueduct velocity on routine brain mri is the presence of void in the csf flow although traditionally considered a useful sign for nph they are increasingly seen in normal subject examined on higher field mri scanner in brain composition periventricular hypoattenuation on ct or the corresponding high flair signal on mri may be considered a supportive sign for nph however this is a nonspecific feature a periventricular change are common in the elderly brain reflecting chronic microvascular ischemia or even in the setting of acute hydrocephalus a transependymal edema,
