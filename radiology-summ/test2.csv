"Changes in CSF flow : MR CSF flow studies in NPH shows an increase in peak CSF velocity in the cerebral aqueduct, as well as an increase in CSF volumes in the aqueduct. A subsidiary feature of the increased aqueduct velocity on routine brain MRI is the presence of voids in the CSF flow. Although  traditionally  considered  a  useful  sign  for  NPH,  they are increasingly seen in normal subjects examined on  higher field MRI scanners [1,2,10].â€¢Changes      in      brain      composition:      Periventricular      hypoattenuation  on  CT,  or  the  corresponding  high  T2 FLAIR  signal  on  MRI,  may  be  considered  a  supportive  sign for NPH. However, this is a nonspecific feature, as periventricular  changes  are  common  in  the  elderly  brain,  reflecting chronic microvascular ischemia, or even in the setting  of  acute  hydrocephalus  as  transependymal  edema  "
