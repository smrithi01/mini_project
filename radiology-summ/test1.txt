Brain MRI demonstrates cortical thickening with reduced gyrification and abnormal  sulcal  depth  and  patterns  that  are  detached  from  the  rest of the affected hemisphere or lobe by deep inward folding of the cortex, giving what is called a lobe within a lobe appearance [3].   These   diseases   are   commonly   associated   with   other   cerebral malformations, such as midline malformation, callosal anomalies,  hypoplasia  of  the  cerebellar  vermis,  ventricular  dysmorphism, and venous malformation [1,3]. Similar findings were found in our case, which demonstrated a  lesion  mimicking  an  accessory  lobule  at  the  right  inferior  frontal surface of the brain with a thickened cortex that was detached  from  the  right  temporal  lobe  by  a  deep  sulcus.  An  atrophic rostral part of the corpus callosum was also observed.
