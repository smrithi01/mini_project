HIP JOINT/LABRUM: Diluted gadolinium contrast was injected into the patient. There is no distinct evidence of 
an acetabular labral tear. There is no high-grade chondral loss or delamination along the acetabular margin. The 
labral morphology is maintained. The ligamentum teres shows borderline thickening. The bony anatomy does not reveal prominent acetabular overhang or retroversion. There is bony prominence of the anterior lateral femoral 
head and neck region as well as mild lack of femoral head and neck offset. This pattern could suggest, in the 
appropriate clinical setting, findings that may predispose to femoral acetabular impingement. 
MUSCLES AND TENDONS: The gluteal tendons are intact. The hamstring tendon origins are intact. 
BONE MARROW: There is no occult or stress fracture or evidence of AVN. 
SYMPHYSIS / SI JOINTS: The bony pelvis is intact including the SI joints and symphysis pubis. With respect to 
the T2 mapping study, sequential coronal and sagittal images obtained with this technique along with graded color 
image analysis as well as corresponding graphing, do not reveal significant derangement or elevation of the T2 
relaxation times that would indicate the presence of early chondral degeneration and collagen fiber breakdown 
in this patient at this time.
