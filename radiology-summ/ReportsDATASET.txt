None available Findings: There
are diffuse bilateral interstitial

consistent with chronic
obstructive lung disease and
bullous emphysema. There are
irregular opacities in the left

a cavitary lesion in the left lung

IMPRESSION
1. Bullous emphysema and
interstitial fibrosis. 2. Probably
scarring in the left apex,
although difficult to exclude a
cavitary lesion. 3. Opacities in
the bilateral upper lobes could
represent scarring, however the
absence of comparison exam,
recommend short interval

Imaging Study
Xray Chest PA and Lateral
PA and Lateral Chest: XXXX

Indication: XXXX-year-old
female, chest pain

Comparison: None

Impression:
1. Cardiomegaly and small left
pleural effusion versus pleural
thickening
2. Streaky and patchy bibasilar
opacities may be compatible
with
atelectasis versus
consolidation, aspiration, clinical
correlation
recommended

Findings: Heart size moderately
enlarged. Mild left costophrenic
XXXX blunting. Streaky and
patchy bibasilar opacities, left
greater
than right. Right hemidiaphragm
eventration noted. No typical
findings of pulmonary edema.

Findings
The lungs appear clear. The

on this study XXXX. A there are
calcified mediastinal and hilar
lymph XXXX suggesting prior
histoplasmosis infection. The
pleural spaces are clear.

Impression
1. Stable tortuosity of the
thoracic aorta. The presence of
an underlying aneurysm cannot

Comparison: None. Findings:
No acute osseous
abnormalities. Left midlung, and
basilar streaky opacity. There is
elevation of the left

IMPRESSION
No acute osseous
abnormalities. If continued
clinical concern for rib fracture
dedicated rib films will be
helpful. Left midlung, and left
basilar streaky opacity may
represent atelectasis.
